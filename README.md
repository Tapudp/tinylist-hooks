### About

This project has followed the following requirements:

- Make sure web app is responsive to different screen sizes
- Display fixed header with TinyList logo
- First row is “+ Add to list…” which user can click to type in anything. The entered text should replace the “Add to list…” placeholder.
- When user hits “enter/return”, create item. Only create item if there is at least 1 character in the field.
- Display uncompleted items first, with the most recently created item at the top
- Then display completed items, with the most recently completed item at the bottom. Completed items should be greyed out with strikethrough.
- On desktop, do not always display all trash cans. Only when user hovers over each row, highlight the row and display its trash can on the right
- When user clicks on trash can, delete the item
- When user clicks on any existing item, allow user to edit the text right there
- BONUS: When user checks, unchecks or creates a new task, use slide animation to show the task moving to its new position in the list according to the sorting logic above.
